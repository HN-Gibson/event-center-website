# Gibson Event Center Website

This is the code source for my multi-page website created as a part of my studies at Coding Temple, an Online Softtware Engineering Bootcamp. 

All the content in this project is ficticious and does not reflect a real event center.

The goal is to showcase my abilities with HTML/CSS to create a functioning website.

## The Website:

- **Home Page** ('index.html') w/ welcome and more about the event center.
- **Events Page** ('events.html') highlighting 3 upcoming events.
- **Menu Page** ('menu.html') displays information related to food offerings w/ images available on hover or select of item name.
- **Location Page** ('location.html') offers information about where to find the center as well as hours of operation.
- **Contact Us Page** ('contact_us.html') provides a form for users to submit a message to the staff for follow-up.

- All features are scaled to the size of the device and should display on any device correctly.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to select directory of your choice:

    git clone https://github.com/HN-Gibson/event-center-website.git

2. Open project in preferred code editor.

3. Open 'index.html' in your browser 

    - You may also make the project live using your code editor to navigate the website.

4. Enjoy viewing the website and please provide any feedback to the author.
